/**
 * An array's length, like the data types it can contain, is not fixed. Arrays can be defined with a length of any number of elements, and elements can be added or removed over time; in other words, arrays are mutable. In this challenge, we will look at two methods with which we can programmatically modify an array: Array.push() and Array.unshift().

Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the push() method adds elements to the end of an array, and unshift() adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:
 */

function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.push(7, "VIII", 9);
  arr.unshift("I", 2, "three");
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(["IV", 5, "six"]));
